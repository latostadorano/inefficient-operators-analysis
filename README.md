# Inefficient Operators Analysis

A data analytics project focused on identifying underperforming call center operators and uncovering the root causes behind operational inefficiencies. Using Python, SQL, and KPI-driven visualizations, this analysis highlights performance gaps and provides actionable insights for improving operational efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Call centers rely heavily on consistent operator performance, yet inefficiencies can easily hide within thousands of records.  
This project analyzes operator behavior to uncover unusual patterns in response time, handling time, and resolution quality.  
The goal is to pinpoint bottlenecks, low-performing operators, and the operational factors that contribute to performance drops.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect operators whose performance falls significantly below expected benchmarks  
- Identify patterns and root causes that contribute to inefficiency  
- Provide actionable recommendations supported by data  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **SQL**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Key Contributions
- Analyzed thousands of call center records using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and SQL to flag unusual patterns in handling time, response time, and resolution rates.
- Built clear KPI visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn that helped stakeholders quickly identify bottlenecks and operators falling more than 20 percent below performance benchmarks.
- Identified root causes such as idle time spikes and workload imbalances that contributed to low performance.
- Delivered recommendations that supported measurable improvements in operator efficiency.

## 📈 Example Insights
Some of the findings visualized in the analysis include:

- Operators with abnormally long average handling times  
- Work shifts correlated with productivity drops  
- Resolution-rate declines tied to workload distribution  
- Hours of the day where idle time spikes by over 30 percent
